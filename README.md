# Statistics- Multiple Linear Regression 
 MLR Analysis on Population Data
 
This project aims to analyze the factors affecting the annual rate of population change using a multiple regression model. The average annual rate of population change of 140 different countries is predicted depending on the various independent variables like Total Fertility Rate (live births per woman), Life Expectancy at birth(years), Maternal Mortality Ratio, GDP per Capita, Employment to Population Ratio and Migration Rate of the given countries.
The data is sourced from the UNdata website (http://data.un.org/) which consists of population-related data for the years in range 2010-2015. The data is merged from 7 different datasets taken from the above-mentioned website to analyze multiple factors affecting population change rate. Before starting the analysis all the datasets are merged into one complete dataset and the missing values are removed from all the columns for better predictions.
